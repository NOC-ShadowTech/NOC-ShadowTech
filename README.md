Hello! Iâ€™m Tristin, but online you might know me as Shadowbat. At 16 years old, Iâ€™m deeply passionate about software engineering and aim to transform this hobby into a full-time career. Iâ€™m intrigued by how computer programs and video games function and thrive on exploring new technologies. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me gaming and diving into tech innovations. ðŸŒŸðŸ’»ðŸŽ®
